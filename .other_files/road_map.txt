Phase 1: Research & Planning (1 week) 

	Define core features: text-to-sound effects, audio import/export, effect preview.
	Identify target users: content creators, podcasters, video editors.
	Study existing solutions (Descript, Adobe Audition, AI audio tools) to find differentiators.
	Decide tech stack: Python (for AI processing), React (frontend), Node.js (backend), or entirely in Python with a GUI.

Phase 2: Data & Model Preparation (2 weeks)

	Collect datasets: sounds libraries, labeled audio clips.
	Choose AI model: pretrained audio generation or text-to-sound models (like AudioLM, MusicLM, or open-source alternatives).
	Fine-tune the model to generate or suggest sound effects from text prompts.

Phase 3: Backend Development (2–3 weeks) 

	Build API for processing audio files and generating effects.
	Implement file upload/download.
	Integrate the AI model for audio editing.
	Ensure scalability and speed for real-time or near-real-time processing.

Phase 4: Frontend Development (2–3 weeks) 

	Design intuitive UI: audio waveform visualization, text prompt input, effect selection.
	Implement audio preview before applying effects.
	Provide drag-and-drop audio file support.
	Connect frontend to backend API.

Phase 5: Testing & Iteration (2 weeks) working on it....

	Test with various audio types (voice, music, ambient sounds).
	Collect feedback from beta users.
	Fix bugs, optimize AI model for better sound quality.

Phase 6: Launch & Deployment (1 week)

	Deploy on web or desktop platform.
	Add user authentication if needed.
	Provide basic tutorial or demo.
	Monitor usage and fix post-launch issues.

Phase 7: Future Enhancements

	Multi-track audio editing.
	More advanced AI effects (e.g., style transfer for audio).
	Cloud storage integration.
	Collaboration features for teams.
